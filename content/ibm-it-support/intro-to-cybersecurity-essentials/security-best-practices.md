### Single sign-on
  
  SSO verifies users for connected accounts or apps, so they only have to log in once.
- Businesses use SSO to simplify and speed up access to resources.
- IT departments set up SSO, so employees are automatically logged in when they log into their work networks.

## **Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting**

### **The three A’s**
  
  There are three processes involved in logging in to a network or account.

#### Access control

- Rules of the least privilege (ROLP)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) follows a company’s org chart.

#### Authorization
  
  Authorization is when you have permissions to access a location or do an action.
  
  Access control must be setup before authorization is granted.
  
  Authorization must be set up for your user account before you’re able to log in.

#### Authentication
  
  Authentication is the act of confirming the identity of a user.

### Non-repudiation
  
  Non-repudiation is when you can’t deny being in a specific location. It guarantees a message sent between two parties is genuine.

## **Ways to Hardening Devices**

- Device hardening
- Patching updates
- Firmware updates
	- Secure boot
	- TPM
	- Drive Encryption
- Encryption
- Device lock
- Disable features and ports
	- Autorun
	- Bluetooth
	- NFC
- Apps that harden
	- Antivirus
	- Anti-malware
	- Ani-spyware
	- Software firewalls and VPNS
- Change default password and disable admin accounts

### Device hardening
  
  Hardening is the process of securing a device to minimize vulnerabilities.
  
  Harden devices by:
- Disabling unneeded features.
- Updating firmware, OS, and software.
- Using firewalls, VPN, and anti-malware.
  
  The more layers of security you use, the safer your data and devices will be.

## **Validation and Device Usage**

- Software sources validation
- Use OEM websites
- Avoid third-party websites or use with caution
- Uninstall unwanted software (bloatware)
- Keep your computer safe while browsing
- Firewalls and VPNs
- Disable admin accounts
- Keep software updated

## **Encryption concepts**

### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
  
  PKI is when a user is validated with a digital certificate by a Certificate Authority (CA).

### Cryptographic hashes
  
  A cryptographic hash is a short string of numbers and letters created by running a password or file through an algorithm.

## **Email and Spam Management**

### Managing email
  
  Email management is classifying email messages and deciding whether they should be saved or deleted.
- Keep inbox clean
- Organize with folders
- Filter with rules
- Unsubscribe
- Turn off notifications

### Identify and manage spam
  
  Spam is unwanted, unsolicited email. Some spam is harmless, but it can be dangerous when scammers use it for phishing or fraud.
  
  To reduce spam:
- Don’t give out your email address.
- Use throwaway accounts.
- Configure settings to block spam.
- Use a full-featured mail app.
