  + The teams can discuss issues, plans, and procedure without any hiccups.
  
  To improve the customer ticketing system:
  + There should be proper documentation of to use it, so every time an employee doesn't have to go to the IT person for help.

  + There should be on-site and off-site backups for sensitive data for redundancy purposes.
  + The cloud backup solutions can also be used for a small company.
  + Self-hosted backups should be automatic, and redundant.
  + Backups tests and recovery should be done once every year or so, to make sure in the case of an emergency, your backups will prove reliable.
