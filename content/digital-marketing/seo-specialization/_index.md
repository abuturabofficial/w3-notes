This specialization is offered by **UCDAVIS** over Coursera. There are **4 Courses** and a **Capstone Project** in this specialization.

> [!INFO]
> I got access to the first course for free and have completed it; it was worth my time. However, the rest of the specialization requires payment, which I am not inclined to make at the moment as I currently have no use case for the knowledge I would gain.
