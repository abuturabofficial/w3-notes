- Require more holistic approach with a knowledge of relevant signals
- Optimized content now relates to overall page concept not keywords

- SEOs must deal with the shifting methods of keyword research and optimization

## **Strengthening Your Keyword Strategy**

### Topic Association
  
“Used by search engines to determine relevancy and trustworthiness”
- Search engines analyze contextual meaning to find relevance to topic/theme
- Page should contain keywords relevant to focus keyword, rather than repeating the focus keyword, Examples;
  + Winemaking: wine, vineyard, wine growing, wine production
  + Support: learn, instructors, students, tuition
  + certification: course, class, lecture, program, certificate
- Long-tail optimization
  + Where can I learn to make wine?
  + How do I get a certificate in winemaking?
- Focus keyword can be broken up into synonyms and other elements
- What other ways can I describe the theme?
- What other words would be relevant?
- What other words support the page topic?
- Page should contain supporting keywords
- Having content that has a cohesive theme results in “long tail keywords”
  + Long-tail keywords are longer words or phrases – difficult to predict but very targeted
- Algorithm was updated to check for relevancy and semantic relationships
  + Semantic analysis looks at how words are related
  + After Hummingbird, semantic and related results were even clearer
