- Helpful for content that may generate lots of social shares
- Gives topic ideas for site content

### **Demographic Data**

- Websites providing such data:
  + Alexa

  + Google Analytics

#### Alexa

- Audience insights help create user centered content

#### SimilarWeb
- Shows potential topics users might be interested in
- Shows traffic sources giving you ideas of where to promote content

- Data is reliable as it is taken from Twitter (as reliable as Twitter :-)
- Twitter profiles/info can be fake
- `Followerwonk` cannot always identify follower gender

## **Creating Your Ideal Buyers Persona**

### Buyer Personas

- Fictional characters representing specific users of a website
- Personas help build user-centered sites & incorporate correct keywords naturally
- Create multiple personas to appeal to a variety of buyers

> Couple of questions about our buyers

- Persona's Age
  + Age could impact keyword choices due to lexicon differences
- Persona's Location
  + Persona's location Important in case of regional vocabulary differences
- Persona's Gender
  + Buyer's gender can influence vocabulary
  + Gender plays a larger role in than just their vocabulary
  + Sites might need a persona for both genders
- An image of a person brings your persona to life
- Add lots of details, since it will guide your site optimization
- Add additional information for your reference if applicable
  + for example: Is it a B2B or B2C persona?
