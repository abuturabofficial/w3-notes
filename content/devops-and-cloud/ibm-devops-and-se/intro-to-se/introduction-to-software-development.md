## **Overview of Web and Cloud Development**
  
  **Cloud Applications**
- Built to work seamlessly with a Cloud-based back-end infrastructure
- Cloud-based data storage and data processing, and other Cloud services, making them scalable and resilient
  
  **Building websites and cloud applications:**
  
  The environment is divided into two primary areas:
  
1. **Front-End**
  - Deals with everything that happens at the client-side
  - Specializes in front-end coding, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and related frameworks, libraries, and tools
1. **Back-End**
  - Deals with the server before the code and data are sent to the client
  - Handles the logic and functionality and the authentication processes that keep data secure
  - Back-end developers may also work with relational or NoSQL databases
  
Full-stack developers have skills, knowledge, and experience in both front-end and back-end environments.
  
**Developers Tools:**
- Code editor
- IDE

## **Learning Front-End Development**

- HTML is used to create the structure and CSS is used to design it and make it appealing
- CSS is also used to create websites that have cross browser compatibility such as PC, mobiles devices etc.
- JS adds interactivity
  
  **A front-end development language is Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (SASS)**
- An extension of CSS that is compatible with all versions of CSS.
- SASS enables you to use things like variables, nested rules, inline imports to keep things organized.
- SASS allows you to create style sheets faster and more easily.
  
  **Learner Style Sheets (LESS)**
- `LESS` enhances CSS, adding more styles and functions.
- It is backwards compatible with CSS.
- Less.js is a JS tool that converts the `LESS` styles to CSS styles.
  
  **Websites are designed as reactive and responsive**
- Reactive or adaptive websites display the version of the website designed for a specific screen size.
- A website can provide more information if opened on a PC than when opened on a mobile device.
- Responsive design of a website means that it will automatically resize to the device.
- If you open up a products' website on your mobile device, it will adapt itself to the small size of the screen and still show you all the features.
  
**JavaScript's frameworksorks:**
  
  Angular Framework:
- an open-source framework maintained by google
- Allows websites to render HTML pages quickly and efficiently
- Tools for routing and form validation
  
  React.js:
- Developed and maintained by Meta
- It is a JS library that builds and renders components for a web page
- Routing is not a part of this framework and will need to be added using a third-party tool
  
  Vue.js:
- maintained by the community and its main focus is the view layer which includes UI, buttons, visual components
- Flexible, scalable, and integrates well with other frameworks
- Very adaptable – it can be a library, or it can be the framework
  
  **The task of a front-end developer evolves continuously.**
- The technologies are upgraded constantly, and so the front-end developers need to keep upgrading the websites that they create.
- The websites that they create should work in multiple browsers, multiple operating systems, and multiple devices.

## **The importance of Back-End Development**

- Creates and manages resources needed to respond to client requests
- Enables server infrastructure to process request, supply data and provide other services securely
  
  **What does the back-end developer do?**
- Process the data you enter while browsing, such as:
  - Login information
  - Product searches
  - Payment information
- Write and maintain the parts of the application that process the inputs
  
**Back-End Developer skills:**
  
Examples of tasks and associated skills that back-end developers need:

**APIs, routing, and endpoints:**
- APIs, routes, and endpoints process requests from the Front-End
  - API is a code that works with data
  - Routes is a path to a website or page
  - Endpoint can be an API or route
- Back-end developers create routes to direct requests to correct service
- APIs provide a way for Cloud Apps to access resources from the back-end
  
**Back-end languages and frameworks:**
  
Some popular back-end languages are:
- JavaScript
  - Node.js
  - Express
- Python
  - Django
  - Flask

**Working with databases:**

Languages and tools for working with databases:
- Structured Query Language (SQL)
- Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)

## **Introducing Application Development Tools**
  
  A cloud application developer’s workbench includes:
- Version Control
- Libraries
  - Collection of reusable code
  - Multiple code libs can be integrated into a project
  - Call from your code when required
  - Used to solve a specific problem or add a specific feature

![Introduction to Software Development](/notes/ibm-devops-and-se/Introduction%20to%20Software%20Development-2.webp)

**Frameworks:**
- Provide a standard way to build and deploy applications
- Act as a skeleton you extend by adding your own code
- Dictate the architecture of the app
- Call your code
- Allow you less control than libs
  
  **Inversion of Control:**
- Libs allow you to call functions as when required
- Frameworks define the workflow that you must follow
- Inversion of control makes the framework extensible

  **More tools:**
- CI/CD
- Build tools
  - Transform source code into binaries for installation
  - Important in environments with many interconnected projects and multiple developers
  - Automate tasks like
    - Downloading dependencies
    - Compiling source code into binary code
    - Packaging that binary code
    - Running Tests
    - Deployment to production systems

Examples of Build Tools:

**Packages:**
- Packages make apps easy to install
- Packages contain
  - App files
  - Instructions for installation
  - Metadata
	  
Package managers:
- Make working with packages easier
- Coordinate with file archives to extract package archives
- Verify checksums and digital certificates to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the package
- Locate, download, install, or update existing software from a software repository
- Manage dependencies to ensure a package is installed with all packages it requires

## **Introduction to Software Stacks**
  
  **What is a software stack?**
- Combination of technologies
- Used for creating applications and solutions
- Stacked in a hierarchy to support the application from user to computer hardware
- Typically include;
  - Front-end technologies
  - Back-end technologies
  
  **Parts of the software stack:**
  
  ![Introduction to Software Development](/notes/ibm-devops-and-se/Introduction%20to%20Software%20Development-7.webp)
  
  **Examples of software stack:**
- Python-Django
- Ruby on Rails
- ASP .NET
- LAMP
- MEAN
- MEVN
- MERN
  
**LAMP Stack:**

**MEAN and relasted stacks:**

![Introduction to Software Development](/notes/ibm-devops-and-se/Introduction%20to%20Software%20Development-9.webp)

**Comparison of MEAN, MEVN, and LAMP:**
- MEAN
  - All parts use JS – one language to learn
  - Lost of documentation and reusable code
  - Not suited to large-scale applications or relational data
- MEVN
  - Similar to MEAN
  - Less reusable libs
- LAMP
  - Lots of reusable code and support
  - Only on Linux
  - Not suited in non-relational data
  - Uses different languages
