## **What is Software Engineering?**

- Application of scientific principles for design and creation of software
- Systematic approach to software development
  - Design
  - Build
  - Test

**Software Crisis:**
- Began in mid-1960s
- Resulted from software development that ran over budget and behind schedule with unmanageable and buggy code
- By the time old software solutions were developed, the newer technologies got the traction, and code refactoring would become necessary
- Solutions didnâ€™t scale well to large projects
  
  Engineering principles:
- Resolved as standardized methods in software engineering and computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools were developed

  **SE responsibilities:**
- Design, build and maintain software systems
- Write and test code
- Consult with stakeholders, third party vendors' security specialists, and other team members
  
  **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):**
- Scientific approach to software development
- Guides the software development process
- Identifies discrete steps needed to develop software

## **Introduction to SDLC**

- Systematic process to develop high-quality software
- Aims to produce software that meets requirements
- Defined phases with their own processes and deliverables
- Cycle of planning, design, and development
- Minimizes development risks and costs
  
  **History of the SDLC:**
- Conceived of in the mid-1960s
- A deliberate approach needed to manage complex projects
- Initially used the waterfall method
- Adapted to use iterative methods
  
  **Advantages of the SDLC:**
- Improves efficiency and reduce risks
- Team members know what they should be working on and when
- Facilitates communication among stakeholders
- Team members know when development can move to the next phase
- Respond to changing requirements
- Solve problems early in the process
- Reduces overlapping responsibilities

## **Phases of the SDLC**

- Organizations may have different names for each stage
- Some organizations have more or fewer stages

![The Software Development Lifecycle](/notes/ibm-devops-and-se/SDLC%20-%20The%20Software%20Development%20Lifecycle-3.webp)

### Phase 3: Development
  
Development starts when the design document is finalized and sent to the developers to write code for it.

### Phase 4: Testing

- Code is tested to ensure stability, security, and that it meets requirements from the SRS
- Bugs reported, tracked, fixed, and retested
  
  Some common tests:
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- System testing
- Acceptance testing

### Phase 5: Deployment

## **Building Quality Software**
  
  **Common software engineering processes:**
- Requirements gathering
- Design
- Coding for quality
- Testing
- Release
- Documenting

### Requirement Gathering

- The SRS encompasses the process of collecting and documenting the set of requirements that the software needs to adhere to
- It may include a set of use cases that describe the business needs and user flows that the software must implement
  
  Software requirements can be classified into four broad categories:
  1. Functionality
  2. External & user interface
  3. System features
  4. Non-functional

### Design

- Transforming requirements into code
- Breaking down requirements into sets of related components
- Communicating business rules and application logic

### Coding for quality
  
  It refers to characteristics of the code, including attributes:
- Maintainability
- Readability
- Testability
- Security
  
  Quality code must fulfill the intended requirements of the software without defects
- Clean and consistent
- Easy to read and maintain
- Well documented
- Efficient
  
  Coding for quality entails a following set of coding practices during development;
- Following coding standards
- Using linters to detect errors
- Commenting in the code itself to make it easy to understand and modify

### Testing
  
  The process of verifying that the software matches established requirements and is free of bugs
- Identify errors, gaps, or missing requirements
- Ensures reliability, security, performance, and efficiency
- Software testing can often be automated or done manually
  
  The types of testing are;
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- System testing
- User acceptance testing (UAT) or Beta testing

### Releases
  
  | Alpha                          | Beta               | General Availability |
  | ------------------------------ | ------------------ | -------------------- |
  | Select stakeholders            | All stakeholders   | Stable               |
  | May contain errors             | User testing       | All users            |
  | Preview of functioning version | Meets requirements |                      |
  | Design changes may occur       |                    |                      |

### Documenting
  
**System documentation:**

README files, inline comments, architecture and design documents, verification information, and maintenance guides

# **The Software Building Process and Associated Roles**

## **Software Development Methodologies**
  
**Common development methodologies:**

A process is needed to clarify communication and facilitates information sharing among team members.

Some of these methodologies are:
- Waterfall

![The Software Development Lifecycle](/notes/ibm-devops-and-se/SDLC%20-%20The%20Software%20Development%20Lifecycle-6.webp)

- V-shape model

![The Software Development Lifecycle](/notes/ibm-devops-and-se/SDLC%20-%20The%20Software%20Development%20Lifecycle-7.webp)

- Agile

## **Software Versions**

- Software versions are identified by version numbers,  indicate:
  - When the software was released
  - When it was updated
  - If any minor changes or fixes were made to the software
- Software developers use versioning to keep track of new software, updates, and patches
  
  **Version numbers:**
- Version numbers can be short or long, with 2, ,3, or 4 set
- Each number set is divided by a period
- An application with a 1.0 version number indicates the first release
- Software with many releases and updates will have a larger number
- Some use dates for versioning, such as Ubuntu Linux version **18.04.2** released in 2018 April, with a change shown in the third number set
  
  **What do version numbers mean?**
  
  Some version numbers follow the semantic numbering system, and have 4 parts separated by a period
- the first number indicates major changes to the software, such as a new release
- The second number indicates that minor changes were made to a piece of software
- The third number in the version number indicates patches or minor bug fixes
- The fourth number indicates build numbers, build dates, and less significant changes
  
![The Software Development Lifecycle](/notes/ibm-devops-and-se/SDLC%20-%20The%20Software%20Development%20Lifecycle-13.webp)
  
  **Version compatibility:**
- Older versions may not work as well in newer versions
- Compatibility with old and new versions of software is a common problem
- Troubleshoot compatibility issues by viewing the software version
- Update software to a newer version that is compatible
- Backwards-compatible software functions properly with older versions of files, programs, and systems

## **Software Testing**

- Integrate quality checks throughout SDLC
- Purpose
  - Ensure software meets requirements
  - Error-free software
	  
**Test cases:**

![The Software Development Lifecycle](/notes/ibm-devops-and-se/SDLC%20-%20The%20Software%20Development%20Lifecycle-14.webp)

### Three types of testing:
  
![The Software Development Lifecycle](/notes/ibm-devops-and-se/SDLC%20-%20The%20Software%20Development%20Lifecycle-15.webp)

1) **Functional testing:**

![The Software Development Lifecycle](/notes/ibm-devops-and-se/SDLC%20-%20The%20Software%20Development%20Lifecycle-16.webp)

The purpose of functional is to check:
- Usability
- Accessibility

2) **Non-functional testing**

Its attributes are:
- Performance
- Security
- Scalability
- Availability

Non-functional testing questions:
- How does the application behave under stress?
- What happens when many users log in at the same time?
- Are instructions consistent with behavior?
- How does the application behave under different OSs?
- How does the application handle disaster recovery?
- How secure is the application?

3) **Regression Testing**
- Confirms changes donâ€™t break the application
- Occurs after fixes such as change in requirements or when defects are fixed

Choosing test cases for regression testing:

### Testing levels
  
Unit â†’ Integration â†’ System â†’ Acceptance

1) **Unit testing**
- Test a module code
- Occurs during the build phase of the SDLC
- Eliminate errors before integration with other modules

2) **Integration testing**
- Identify errors introduced when two or more modules are combined
- Type of black-box test
- Occurs after modules are combined into larger application

Purpose of integration testing:

![The Software Development Lifecycle](/notes/ibm-devops-and-se/SDLC%20-%20The%20Software%20Development%20Lifecycle-18.webp)

3) **System testing**
- Compliance with SRS
- Validate the system
- Functional and non-functional
- Staging environment

4) **Acceptance testing**
