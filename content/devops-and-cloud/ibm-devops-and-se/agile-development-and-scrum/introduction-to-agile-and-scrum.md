- **> 70%** of organizations have incorporated some Agile approaches. — Project Management Institute
- **28%** more successful using agile than traditional projects. — Price Waterhouse Coopers
- **47%** agile transformations' failure rate. — Forbes
	- \#1 reason is inexperience with implementing and integrating the Agile methodology. — VersionOne
- Agile is a mindset that requires culture change.
- It’s hard to learn Agile from just reading a book.
- Recognizing when something is wrong is just as important as knowing how to do something right.

## **Introduction to Agile Philosophy: Agile Principles**
  
**What is Agile?**

Agile is an iterative approach to project management that helps teams be responsive and deliver value to their customers faster

**Agile defining characteristics:**

Agile emphasizes:
- Adaptive planning
- Evolutionary development
- Early delivery
- Continual improvement
- Responsiveness to change

**Agile Manifesto:**

We have come to value:

**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.

**Working software** over comprehensive documentation.

**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation.

**Responding to change** over following a plan.

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

**Agile Software development:**
- An iterative approach to software development consistent with Agile Manifesto
- Emphasizes flexibility, interactivity, and a high level of transparency
- Uses small, co-located, cross-functional, self-organizing teams

**Key takeaway:**

Build what **is** needed, not what **was** planned.

## **Methodologies Overview**

### Traditional Waterfall Development:
  
![Introduction to Agile and Scrum](/notes/Introduction%20to%20Agile%20and%20Scrum.png)
  
  **Problems with waterfall approach:**
- No provisions for changing requirements
- No idea if it works until the end
- Each step ends when the next begins
- Mistakes found in the later stages are more expensive to fix
- There is usually a long time between software releases
- Teams work separately, unaware of their impact on each other
- The people who know the least about the code are deploying it into production

### Extreme Programming (XP)

- In 1996 Kent Beck introduced XP
- Based on an interactive approach to software development
- Intended to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements
- One of the first Agile method
  
![Introduction to Agile and Scrum](/notes/Introduction%20to%20Agile%20and%20Scrum-1.png)
  
  **Extreme Programming values:**
- Simplicity
- Communication
- Feedback
- Respect
- Courage

### Kanban
  
**What is Kanban?**

Kanban | 'kanban | noun

(also Kanban system) a Japanese manufacturing system in which the supply of components is regulated through the use of an instruction card sent along the production line.
- An instruction card used in a Kanban system.

Origin

1970s: Japanese, Literally mean ‘billboard, sign’

**Core principles of Kanban:**
- Visualize the workflow
- Limit work in progress (WIP)
- Manage and enhance the flow
- Make process policies explicit
- Continuously improve

## Working Agile

- Working in small batches
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
- Test Driven Development (TDD) (Gherkin Syntax — Developed by Cucumber Company)
- Pair programming

## **Introduction to Scrum Methodology**
  
**Agile and Scrum:**
- Agile is a **philosophy** for doing work (not prescriptive)
- Scrum is a **methodology** for doing work (add process)

## **Scrum Overview**
  
  Scrum:
- Is a management framework for incremental product development
- Prescribes small, cross-functional, self-organizing teams
- Provides a structure of roles, meeting, rules, and artifacts
- Uses fixed-length iterations called **sprints**
- Has a goal to build a potentially shippable product increment with every iteration
- Easy to Understand – Difficult to master
  
  **Sprint:**
- A sprint is one iteration through the design, code, test, and deploy cycle
- Every sprint should have a goal
- 2 weeks in duration
  
**Steps in the Scrum process:**

## **The 3 Roles of Scrum**
  
**Scrum roles:**
- Product owner
- Scrum master
- Scrum team
  
1. **Product owner:**
  - Represents the stakeholder interests
  - Articulates the product vision
  - Is the final arbiter of requirements' questions
  - Constantly re-prioritizes the product backlog, adjusting any expectations
  - Accepts or rejects each product increment
  - Decides whether to ship
  - Decides whether to continue development
1. **Scrum master:**
  - If your team is experienced, you might skip this role, but if you have a team new to Scrum, you require an experienced Scrum master.
    - Facilitates the Scrum process
    - Coaches the team
    - Creates an environment to allow the team to be self-organizing
    - Shields the team from external interference to keep it “in the zone”
    - Helps resolve impediments
    - Enforces sprint timeboxes
    - Captures empirical data to adjust forecasts
    - Has no management authority over the team
2. **Scrum Team:**
  - A cross-functional team consisting of
  	- Developers
  	- Testers
  	- Business analysts
  	- Domain experts
  	- Others
  - Self-organizing
	- There are no externally assigned roles
  - Self-managing
  	- They self-assign their own work
  - **Membership:** consists of 7 ± 2 collaborative members
  - **Co-located:** most successful when located in one team room, particularly for the first few Sprints
  - **Dedicated:** Most successful with long-term, full-time membership
  - Negotiates commitments with the product owner – one sprint at a time
  - Has autonomy regarding how to reach commitments

## **Artifacts, Events, and Benefits**
  
  **Scrum Artifacts:**
- Product backlog
- Sprint backlog
- Done increment
  
  **Scrum events:**
- Sprint planning meeting
- Daily Scrum meeting (a.k.a. daily stand-up)
- Sprint
- Sprint review
- Sprint retrospective
  
  **Benefits of Scrum:**
- Higher productivity
- Better product quality
- Reduced time to market
- Increased stakeholders satisfaction
- Better team dynamics
- Happier employees

## **Organizing for Success: Organizational impact of Agile**
  
  **Organize for success:**
- Proper organization is critical to success
- Existing teams may need to be reorganized
  
  **Conway’s Law:**
  
  “Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.”
  >— Melvin Conway, Datamation, 1968
  
  **Examples of Conway’s Law:**
  
  If you ask an organization with four teams to write a compiler
  … you will get a 4-pass compiler!
  
  **How teams should be aligned?**
- Teams are loosely coupled, tightly aligned
- Each team has its own mission aligned with the business (like a “mini startup”)
- Teams have end-to-end responsibility for what they build
- The long-term mission is usually around a single business domain
  
  **Autonomy is important:**
- It’s motivating – and motivated people build better stuff
- It’s fast – decisions happen locally in the team
- It minimizes handoffs and waiting, so teams don’t get bogged down
  
**The Agile dilemma!**

**The entire organization must be Agile:**

**Agile + DevOps = Alignment**

## **Mistaking Iterative Development for Agile**
  
The biggest pitfall for companies is that, they think they’re agile, but actually they're just doing an iterative work.

![Introduction to Agile and Scrum](/notes/Introduction%20to%20Agile%20and%20Scrum-8.png)
  
  **Agile is not…**
- Agile isn’t a new version of a waterfall, software development life cycle (SDLC), where you do legacy development in sprints
- Agile isn’t just the developers working in each sprint, it involves a cross-functional team
- The Agile Manifesto doesn’t include the term “Agile project management” (and so there are no “project managers” in Agile)
