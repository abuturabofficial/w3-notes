## **Identifying Ports and Connectors**

- Ports enable devices to connect to computers
- Connectors plug into ports
- Each port has a unique function and accepts only specific connectors

### **Interfaces**

- Point of communication between two or more entities
- Can be hardware or software based
  
  ![Interfaces and Connectors](/notes/ibm-it-support/Interfaces%20and%20Connectors-1.png)
  
  Common Interfaces are:
  + USB 
  
  ![Interfaces and Connectors](/notes/ibm-it-support/Interfaces%20and%20Connectors-2.png)

## **Identifying Graphic Devices**

### Display Unit

- Display unit (GPU) connected to the computer via a display card or adapter
- Low-end generic graphic cards come built into the computer
- Require specialized adapters for high-end functions
- ATI/AMD, nVIDIA, SiS, Intel, and Via are leading manufacturers

  ![Interfaces and Connectors](/notes/ibm-it-support/Interfaces%20and%20Connectors-10.png)

### **Display Connectors**

- Different cables and connectors for different display adapters
- Each connector has specific function and benefits
  
  ![Interfaces and Connectors](/notes/ibm-it-support/Interfaces%20and%20Connectors-11.png)

#### HDMI Interface

- Most widely used digital audio and video interface
- Also offers remote control and content protection
- Uses a proprietary 19-pin connector
- Offers up to 8K UHD resolutions

#### DisplayPort

- Royalty-free complement to HDMI
- First interface to use packetized data transmission
- Uses a 20-pin connector
- Can support even different transmission modes of increasing bandwidth

#### Thunderbolt

- Developed by Intel and Apple, primarily for Apple laptops and computers
- Can be used as either a display or peripheral interface
- Initial versions used the MiniDP interface
- Version 3 and now version 4 use the USB-C interface
- Thunderbolt features don’t work with a standard USB-C cable and port

#### Digital Visual Interface (DVI)

- Designed as a high-quality interface for flat-paneled devices
- Support both analog and digital devices
	- DVI-I supports both analog and digital
	- DVI-A supports only analog
	- DVI-D supports only digital
- Single-link for lower resolutions and Dual-link for HDTV
- Superseded by HDMI and Thunderbolt
  
  ![Interfaces and Connectors](/notes/ibm-it-support/Interfaces%20and%20Connectors-12.png)

#### Video Graphics Array (VGA)

- A legacy interface, used for analog video on PC
- Has a 15-pin connector that can be secured with screws

## **Identifying Audio Connectors**

### The audio connection

- Onboard or internal expansion
- Has multiple ports to connect a variety of devices
- Used for multimedia application, education and entertainment, presentation, and teleconferencing
  
  ![Interfaces and Connectors](/notes/ibm-it-support/Interfaces%20and%20Connectors-13.png)

### **Audio connectors**

- Sound cards
- Bluetooth
- Game ports/USB ports
- External audio interfaces

#### External audio interfaces

- Single device for multiple input and output ports
- Mostly used in professional studies
- Use USB, FireWire, Thunderbolt, or similar connectors

## **Wired and Wireless Connections**

### Data packets

- Communication technology allows components to communicate over a network
- Data packets are sent from one smart object to another
	- Information about the sending and receiving device, along with the message
- Devices built to talk over a network can communicate with each other

### Network types

- Closed (limited number of devices can connect)
- Open (unlimited number of devices can connect)
- Either could be wired or wireless

### **Wired connectors**
  
  ![Interfaces and Connectors](/notes/ibm-it-support/Interfaces%20and%20Connectors-14.png)

#### Wire connection benefits

- Faster data transmission
	- Up to 5 Gbps
- More reliable than wireless
	- Immune to signal drops and dead zones
- Less prone to radio interference
- More secure
	- Less likely to be hacked

### **Wireless connections**

- Use different technologies based on connection requirements
- Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi)
	- Connects a router to a modem for network access
- Bluetooth
	- 1998
	- Pairing
- Radio-frequency identification (RFID)
	- Identification and tracks objects using tags
	- Range up to several hundred meters
	- Collection of road tolls
	- Other uses of RFID tags
		- Livestock tracking, tacking pharmaceuticals through warehouses, preventing theft, and expediting checkout in stores
- NFC (Near Field Communication)
	- Based on RFID
	- Extremely short range
	- Transmits data through electromagnetic radio fields

#### Wireless connection advantages

- Increased mobility
- Reduced time to set up
- Flexibility and scalability
- Wider reach
- Lower cost of ownership

## **Peripherals and Printer Connections**

### **Common installation steps**
  
  Computers require software that enables peripheral or printer device recognition and communication using:
  + Onboard Plug and Play software
  + Device driver software
  + Device application software
  Initial stand-alone, peripheral installation often still requires a wired connection or network connection
  1) Connect the printer to the computer using a cable
  2) Turn on the printer
  Frequently used stand-alone peripherals are:
  + USB
  + Bluetooth
  + Wi-Fi
  + NFC
  Three other connection methods are:
  + Serial port
  + Parallel port
  + Network

#### Serial cable connections

- Are less common
- Transmit data more slowly
- RS232 protocol remains in use
	- Data can travel longer distances
	- Better noise immunity
	- Compatibility among manufacturers
- Cables commonly feature 9-pin connections and two screws to secure the cable
  
  ![Interfaces and Connectors](/notes/ibm-it-support/Interfaces%20and%20Connectors-15.png)

#### Parallel port cable connection

- Are less common
- Send and receive multiple bits of data simultaneously
- Feature 25-pin connections
- Include two screws to keep the cable connected
  
  ![Interfaces and Connectors](/notes/ibm-it-support/Interfaces%20and%20Connectors-16.png)

#### Network connections

- Generally, are Wi-Fi or wired Ethernet connections
- Before you begin, verify that your computer has a network connection

#### Connecting to local printers

## **Installation Types**
  
  1) Plug and Play
  2) Driver Installation

### PnP vs. driver installation

- PnP devices work as soon as they’re connected to a computer
- Examples include mice and keyboards
- A malfunctioning device should be investigated in **Device Manager**.
	- Possible cause of malfunction is an outdated driver

### IP-based peripherals

- Hardware connected to a TCP/IP network
- Examples of such devices include wireless routers and security cameras
- These devices must be connected to a local area network (LAN) or the Internet to function

### Web-based configuration

- Different from installation
- Used for networking devices such as routers
- Is an easier process to set up a device
- Completed on a web page
	- Often on the manufacturer’s site
