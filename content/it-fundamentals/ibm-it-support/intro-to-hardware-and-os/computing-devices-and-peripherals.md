## **Identifying Hardware Components and Peripherals**

### What is a computer component?

- A physical part needed for computer functioning, also called “hardware”.
- Each component performs a specific task.
- Components can be internal or external.
- External components connect via ports and connectors.
- Without a given component, such as a CPU, a computer system cannot function as desired.

### Common internal components
  
  A part inside a computing device:
  + RAM
  + Hard Drive
  + CPU

### **Peripherals**

- Connect to the computer to transfer data.
- External devices easily removed and connected to a computer.
- Connections vary
- Examples: Mouse, Printer, and a Keyboard etc.

#### Categories of peripherals

- Input – send commands to the computer
- Output – receive commands from the computer
- Storage – save files indefinitely

#### Connectors for Components

- A connector is the unique end of a plug, jack, or the edge of a card that connects to a port.
- For example, all desktop computer expansion cards have an internal connector that allows them to connect to a slot on the motherboard.
- A Universal Serial Bus (USB) connector at the end of a cable is an example of an external connector.

#### Ports

- A connector plugs into an opening on a computer called a port.
- A port is the jack or receptacle for a peripheral device to plug into.
- Ports are standardized for each purpose.
- Common ports include USB ports and HDMI ports.

## **Input and Pointing Devices**

### Input Devices
  
  + Keyboards
  + Mouse
  + Camera
  + Joystick
  + Trackball

### Pointing Devices

- The stylus (Pen)
  + Input tool
  + Moves the cursor and sends commands
  + Generally used on tablets
  + Uses capacitive technology
  + Detects heat and pressure

## Hard Drives
  
  Hard drives:
  + are a repository for images, video, audio, and text.
  + RAM
  + ROM
  + HDD/SSD/NVMe

### Hard drive performance
  
  Measurement benchmarks
  + Spin speed: how fast the platter spins.
  + Access time: how fast the data is retrieved.
  + Transfer/media rate: how fast the data is written to the drive.

### Connecting an internal hard drive

- Back up data
- transfer the enclosure
- Secure with screws
- prevent movement
- attach to motherboard via SATA/PATA cables
- plug into power supply
- finally, it can be configured in the disk management utility of windows

## **Optical Drives and External Storage**

### **Optical drives**
  
  Reading and writing data
- Laser pressing or “burning”
- Burning pits on lands
- Reflective disk surface
  
  Storage disks
- Single-sided
- Double-side

#### Types of optical drive
  
  Several types
  + CD-ROM
  + CD-RW
  + DVD-ROM
  + DVD-RW
  + Blu-ray

### Solid state drives
  
Solid state drive → (SSD)
- Integrated circuit assemblies store data
- Flash memory
- Permanent, secondary storage
- AKA “solid state drive” or “solid state disk”
- No moving parts
	- Unlike hard disk drives and floppy drives

### External hard drive

- File backup and transfer
- Capacity: 250 GB to 20 TB
	- Several file types
	- USB or eSATA connection
		- eSATA – signal, not power

### **Expansion devices**

- Additional file storage
- Usually, USB
- Frees hard drive space
- Automatically recognized
- Known as a “Thumb drive”
- Holds up to 2 TB of data

#### Flash Drives

- Combines a USB interface and Flash memory
- Highly portable
- Weighs less than an ounce
- Storage has risen as prices have dropped
- Available capacity up to 2 TB

#### Memory card

- Uses Flash memory to store data
- Found in portable devices such as portable media players and smartphones
- Contained inside a device
	- Unlike USB drives
- Available in both Secure Digital (SD) and Micro Secure Digital (MSD) formats

## **Display Devices**
  
  Defining display devices:
- Hardware component for the output of information in visual form
- Tactile monitors present information in a fingertip-readable format
- Often seen as television sets and computer monitors

### Cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors

- Create an image by directing electrons beams over phosphor dots
- Used in monitors throughout the mid to late 1990s
- By 1990, they boasted 800 × 600 pixel resolution

### Flat-screen monitors

- Also known as liquid crystal display (LCD)/ Think film transistor (TFT)
- Digital signal drives color value of each picture element (Pixel)
- Replaced CRT monitors

### Touchscreens

- Use a touch panel on an electronic display
- Capacitive technology measures heat and pressure
- Often found on smartphones, laptops, and tablets

### Projectors

- Take images from a computer and display them
- the surface projected onto is large, flat, and lightly colored
- Projected images can be still or animated

## **Printers and Scanners**

### Output devices
  
“Hardware that shows data in readable form.”
  
  That data can take many forms:
- Scanner and speech synthesizer
- Unnecessary (though highly useful) for computer function

### Printers
  
  + Laser/LED
  + Inkjet
  + Thermal

#### **Shared printers**

- IP-based
- Web-based

### Scanners

- Converts images from analog to digital
- Flatbed (stand alone) or multifunction device

#### Faxes and multifunction devices

- Facsimile (fax) machines send documents using landlines
- Multifunction devices often include fax capabilities

## **Audio Visual Devices**

### Defining audio devices

- Digital data is converted into an audible format
- Components are used to reproduce, record, or process sound
- Examples include microphones, CD players amplifiers, mixing consoles, effects units, and speakers

### Defining visual devices

- Present images electronically on-screen
- Typically, greater than 4" diagonally
- Examples include smartphones, monitors, and laptop computers
