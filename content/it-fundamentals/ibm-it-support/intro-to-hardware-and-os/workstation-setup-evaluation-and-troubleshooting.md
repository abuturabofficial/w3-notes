## **Managing File and Folders**

### Rules for naming files and folders

- Name so the file or folder you want is easy to find
- Make names short but descriptive
- Use 25 characters or fewer
- Avoid using special characters
- Use capitals and underscores
- Consider using a date format

## **Introduction to Workstation Evaluation, Setup, and Troubleshooting**

### **Screen Capture and Tools**

#### Screen capture on macOS
  
  Saves screenshots on the `desktop`.
- Command + shift +3
	- Capture entire screen
- Command + shift +4
	- Capture part of the screen
- Command + shift +5
	- Capture as photo/video

#### Screen captures on Windows
  
  Saves screenshots to the `screenshot` folder.
- Windows + PrintSc
	- Capture entire screen
- Alt + PrintSc
	- Capture active window
- Windows + Shift + S (Opens up snip and sketch tool)
	- Entire screen
	- Part of the screen
	- Active window

#### Screen captures on a Chromebook
  
  Saves screenshots to `Downlaods`  or `Google Drive`.
- Ctrl + Show Windows

	- Capture part of the screen

## **Evaluating Computing Performance and Storage**

### **Assessing processor performance**

- The processor’s speed
- The number of cores
- The bus types and speeds
	- Located on the processor’s perimeter
	- The data highway wiring from the processor to other board components
- The presence of cache or other onboard memory

#### Bus types
  
  Historically, three bus types:

#### Bus alternatives
  
  Replacement technologies include:
  
  ![Workstation Setup and Evaluation and Troubleshooting](/notes/ibm-it-support/Workstation%20Setup%20Evaluation%20and%20Troubleshooting-1.png)
  
  And others.

### Cache

- Consist of processor platform memory that buffers information and speeds tasks
- Can help offset slower processor speeds

### Storage

### RAM error symptoms

- Screen or computer freezes or stops working
- Computer runs more slowly
- Browser tabs error or other error messages display
- Out-of-memory or other error messages display
- Files become corrupt
- Computer beeps
- A “blue screen” with an error message displays

#### Environment

- Is a desk present or needed? If so, is the desk safe and sturdy?
- Is a chair present? If so, is the chair safe and sturdy?
- Is lighting present?
- Are electrical outlets present, of appropriate amperage and grounded?
- Can the use physically secure the computer?

#### Unboxing

- Read and follow the manufacturer’s practices for workstation setup
- Move boxes and packing materials into a safe location, out of the user’s workspace

#### Cable management
  
  Reduce service calls with three practices
- Install shorter cable lengths where possible
- Securely attach and identify each cable
- Collect and tie the cables together

#### Electrical
  
  Safety for you and your user:

## **Advanced Microsoft Windows 10 Management and Utilities**

### Policy management

- Applies rules for passwords, retries, allowed programs, and other settings
- Type “group policy” in the taskbar search box
- View **Edit group policy** and click **open**
- Select the **User Configuration settings** to view its details and edit policy settings

### Process management

- Schedules processes and allocates resources
- Task manager

### Memory management
  
  Windows uses:
- RAM for frequent memory tasks
- Virtual memory for less-frequent tasks
  
  When you notice that:
- Performance is slow
- You see errors that report “low on virtual memory”

### Service management

- Automatically manages background tasks and enables advanced troubleshooting of performance issues.
- Capabilities include:
	- Stopping services
	- Restarting services
	- Running a program
	- Taking no action
	- Restarting the computer

### Driver configuration
  
  Drivers are the software components that enable communications between the operating system and the device

## **Introduction to Business Continuity Principles**

### Business continuity

- Risk management strategies minimize productivity issues
- Business continuity is having a plan to deal with disruptions
- Necessary for all businesses to remain operational under any circumstances

### Fault tolerance

- Ability of a system to continue operating when one or more components fail
- Anticipates disruptions and develops contingency plans
- Design systems without single points of failure

### **Redundancy**

- Minimizes the effects of system outages
- System redundancy strengthens existing fault tolerance levels
- Network redundancy seeks to prevent system outages
- Hardware redundancy serves as a solution to a server outage
- Additional capacity of a computer network above what is needed
- Safety net for the almost inevitable system or component failure
- Backup system at the ready
- 5 types of redundancy

#### Data redundancy

- First type of redundancy
- When the same piece of data exists in multiple places
- Might cause data inconsistency
- Multiple versions of the same file on a network
- Real-time syncing of data across all backups to ensure consistency

#### RAID redundancy

- Redundant array of independent disks (RAID)
- RAID 0: Allows a storage system to tolerate individual disk unit failures
- RAID 1: Exact copy (mirror) of a set of data on two or more disks
- RAID 5: Minimum of three hard disk drives (HDDs) and no maximum

#### Network redundancy

- Process of adding additional network devices and lines of communication
- Features include:
	- Multiple adapter cards and/or ports for individual hosts
	- Load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple servers
	- Multiple network paths
	- Routers can detect issues and reroute data

#### Site redundancy

- Ability to lose an entire site without losing signaling or application state data
- Guards against total loss of operations
- Employs the process of replication to synchronize data among multiple sites
- Ensures data access

#### Power redundancy

- Two independent power sources
- Eliminates potential downtime from the loss of the primary power source
- An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) adds another layer of protection against system downtime
- UPS is less expensive than a backup power generator

### Backup requirements

- Create a copy of data from which a business can restore when the primary copy is damaged or unavailable
- Have a specific and sequential strategy for backups
- Identify key backup concerns
- Select appropriate backup types

#### Backup methods

- Full – Copies all files
- Incremental – Copies only those files that have been altered since the last full backup
- Differential – Saves only the difference in the data since the last full backup
- Daily – keeps a backup of just those files that have been modified the same day the backup is done

#### Backup storage devices

- Used to make copies of data that is actively in use
- Provide redundancy of data residing on primary storage (usually a hard disk drive)
- Examples: USB drive, external hard drive, LAN, and tape

#### Backup considerations

- Costs:
	- Can include hardware, software, maintenance agreement, and training
- Location:
	- Backup to the cloud
	- Consider keeping a data copy in an additional location
- Requirements of each backup approach

### Disaster recovery plan

- Organization’s strategy for restoring functionality to its IT infrastructure
- Explains the actions to be taken before, during, and after a disaster
- Strategies for specific scenarios
- Method depends on needs and resources
