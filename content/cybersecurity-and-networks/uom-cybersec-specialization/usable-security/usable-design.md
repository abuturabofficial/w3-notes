## **Intro to Design**

- Have the insight of the users who are they.
- To include children or not.
- Testing your design with users.
- Involving the users from the very start of your design.
- What other people are doing in your niche, and you should probably design something similar for familiarity reasons of mental models
- Define your goal, is it an innovative idea, or something already existing but adding a value over it.
- Don't wait until your product is finished, take input from the users from the very first stage of design.

## **Design Methodologies**

### Design Process
  
The Golden rule is;
- Know Your User.
- Where do ideas come from?
- Many processes;
  + Iterative design

    ![Iterative Design Process](/notes/Usable%20Design.png)
  
+ System centered design
  - What can be built easily on this platform?
  - What can I create from the available tools?
  - What do I as a programmer find interesting to work on?
	  
+ User centered design
  - Design is based upon a user's
    + Abilities and real needs
    + Context
    + Work
    + Tasks

+ Participatory design
  - Problem
    + intuitions wrong
    + interviews etc. not precise
    + designer cannot know the user sufficiently well to answer all issues that come up during the design
  - Solution
    + designers should have access to a pool of representative users. That is, END users, not their managers or union reps!
	  
+ Designer centered design

## **Case Study: SSL Warnings – example user**

 - User knows something bad is happening, but not what.
	- User has good general strategies (worry more about sites with sensitive info)
	- Error message relies on a lot of information users don't understand
