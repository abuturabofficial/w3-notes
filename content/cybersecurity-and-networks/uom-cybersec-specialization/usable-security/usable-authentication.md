## **Password Authentication**

### Password Attacks

- Human
- Brute force
- Common word
- Dictionary word

### **Two-Factor Authentication**

- Password & one time unique code
  + Generated by
	- Device
	- Email
	- Text
	- App

#### Security of TFA

- More secure
- Stops most hacking attacks
- Users perceive it as more secure

#### Usability of TFA

- Research says:
  + Speed: Slower
  + User Preference;
	- Felt less usable
	- Less convenient
	- Harder to use

## **Biometric Authentication**

- Fingerprints, voice and facial scan etc.

### Usability of Biometrics

- Voice Recognition
  + Speed: medium
  + Efficiency: medium
  + Learnability: easy
  + Memorability: easy
- Facial Recognition
  + Speed: medium
  + Efficiency: medium
  + Learnability: easy
  + Memorability: easy
- Fingerprint Recognition
  + Speed: fast
  + Efficiency: good
  + Learnability: easy
  + Memorability: easy

### Analyzing Security

- Who can access the device?
- How easily can they replicate the biometrics input?

## **Gesture-based Authentication**

- Keypad Gestures
- Free Gestures
- Draw your Signatures
- Multi-touch

### Benefits

- Gestures users enjoy tend to be more secure
- Users prefer gestures to passwords
- Faster than passwords, less error-prone
