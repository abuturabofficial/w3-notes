## **What is Human Computer Interaction?**

“HCI is a study of how humans interact with the computers.”
- It is important to keep in mind how humans interact with the machines.
- Cybersecurity experts, designers etc. should always consider HCI element as the major proponent for design and security infrastructure.
- HCI involves knowing the users, tasks, context of the tasks.
- Evaluation of how easy/difficult it is to use the system.

## **Usability**
  
  “It is a measure of how easy it is to use a system for a user.”

### Measuring Usability

- Speed
  + How quickly can the task be accomplished.
- Efficiency
  + How many mistakes are made in accomplishing the task.
- Learnability
  + How easy is it to learn to use the system.
- Memorability
  + Once learned, how easy is it to remember how to use the system.
- User Preference
  + What do users like?

### How do we measure Usability?

- Speed – timing
- Efficiency – counting error
- Learnability, Memorability and User Preference don't have straight forward measurement tools.

## **Tasks and Task analysis**
  
  “Tasks are goals that users have when interacting with the system.”

### Common errors in task creation

- Leading or too descriptive
  > Click on the username box at the upper right of the screen and enter your username, then click on the password box underneath and enter your password. Click submit…
- Specific questions?
  > What is the third headline on CNN.com?
- Directing users towards things you want to tell them, not what they want to know.
  > What are the names of the members of the website security team?

## **Chunking Information**
  
  “Breaking a long list of pieces of information into smaller groups.”
  “Aggregating several pieces of information into coherent groups to make them easier to remember.”
- When designing systems, the most important thing to consider is human memory, as it is very volatile.
- Working memory's limitations should be kept in mind.
- For design technology products, we should not expect user to remember more than 3 things at a time in his/her working memory.

## Mental Models

  Number of factors affecting mental models;

  + Feedback

    The user sees some visual change when they click a button.
  
  + Constraints
  
    A user should not be allowed to perform a task until certain conditions are met.
  
  + Conventions
  
    There are some conventions in place, for cross culture usability.
