## **Quantitative Evaluation**

### Cognitive Walkthrough
  
Requirements;
- Description or prototype of interface
- Task Description
- List of actions to complete task
- Use background

What you look for; (A mobile Gesture prototype)
- Will users know to perform the action?
- Will users see the control
- Will users know the control does what they want?
- Will users understand the feedback?

### Heuristic Analysis

- Follow 'rules of thumb' or suggestions about good design.
- Can be done by experts/designers, fast and easy.
- May miss problems users would catch.

### Nielsen's Heuristics

- Simple and natural dialog
- Speak the users' language
- Minimize user memory load
- Consistency
- Feedback
- Clearly marked exits
- Shortcuts
- Prevent errors
- Good error messages
- Providing help and documentation

### Personas

- A fictitious user representing a class of users
- Reference point for design and analysis
- Has a goal or goals they want to accomplish (in general or in the system)

## **Running Controlled Experiments**

- State a lucid, testable hypothesis.
- Identify independent and dependent variables
- Design the experimental protocol
- Choose the user population
- Run some pilot participants
- Fix the experimental protocol
- Run the experiment
- Perform statistical analysis
- Draw conclusion
- Communicate results

### Analysis

- Statistical comparison (e.g., t-test)
- Report results

## **Usability Studies**

### Testing Usability of Security

- Security is rarely the task users set out to accomplish.
- Good Security is a seamless part of the task.

### Usability Study Process

- Define tasks (and their importance)
- Develop Questionnaires

### Selecting Tasks

- What are the most important things a user would do with this interface?
- Present it as a task not a question
- Be specific
- Don't give instructions
- Don't be vague or provide tiny insignificant tasks
- Choose representative tasks that reflect the most important things a user would do with the interface

### Security Tasks

- Security is almost never a task

### Pre-Test Questionnaires

- Learn any relevant background about the subject's
- Age, gender, education level, experience with the web, experience with this type of website, experience with this site in particular.
- Perhaps more specific questions based on the site, e.g., color blindness, if the user has children, etc.

### Post-Test Questionnaires

- Have users provide feedback on the interface.

### Evaluation

- Users are given a list of tasks and asked to perform each task.
- Interaction with the user is governed by different protocols.

### Observation Methods

- Silent Observer
- Think Aloud
- Constructive Interaction

### Interview

- Ask users to give you feedback
- Easier for the user than writing it down
- They will tell you, things, you never thought to ask

### Reporting

- After the evaluation, report your results
- Summarize the experiences of users
- Emphasize your insights with specific examples or quotes
- Offer suggestions for improvement for tasks that were difficult to perform

## **A/B Testing**

- Doesn't include any Cognitive or psychological understanding or model of user behavior.
- You give two options, A or B, and measure how they perform.

### How to Run A/B Test

- Start with a small percentage of visitors trying the experimental conditions.
- Automatically stop testing if any condition has very bad performance.
- Let people consistently see the same variation so, they don't get confused.
