## **What is Data Security and Protection?**
  
  Protecting the:
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability
  
  Of Data:
- In transit
- At rest
	- Databases
	- Unstructured Data (files)
	- On endpoints

### What are we protecting against?
  
  **Deliberate attack:**
- Hackers
- Denial of Service
  
  **Inadvertent attacks:**
- Operator error
- Natural disaster
- Component failure

## **Data Security Top Challenges**

- Explosive data growth
- New privacy regulations (GDPR, Brazil’s LGPD etc.)
- Operational complexity
- Cybersecurity skills shortage

## **Data Security Common Pitfalls**
  
  Five epic fails in Data Security:
- Failure to move beyond compliance
- Failure to recognize the need for centralized data security
- Failure to define who owns the responsibility for the data itself
- Failure to address known vulnerabilities
- Failure to prioritize and leverage data activity monitoring

## **Industry Specific Data Security Challenges**

### Healthcare

- Process and store combination of personal health information and payment card data.
- Subject to strict data privacy regulations such as HIPAA.
- May also be subject to financial standards and regulations.
- Highest cost per breach record.
- Data security critical for both business and regulatory compliance.

### Transportation

- Critical part of national infrastructure
- Combines financially sensitive information and personal identification
- Relies on distributed IT infrastructure and third party vendors

### Financial industries and insurance

- Most targeted industry: 19% of cyberattacks in 2018
- Strong financial motivation for both external and internal attacks
- Numerous industry-specific regulations require complex compliance measures

### Retail

- Among the most highly targeted groups for data breaches
- Large number of access points in retail data lifecycle
- Customers and associates access and share sensitive data in physical outlets, online, mobile applications

## **Capabilities of Data Protection**
  
  **The Top 12 critical data protection capabilities:**
1. Data Discovery
  - Where sensitive data resides
  - Cross-silo, centralized efforts
2. Data Classification
  - Parse discovered data sources to determine the kind of data
3. Vulnerability Assessment
  - Determine areas of weakness
  - Iterative process
4. Data Risk analysis
  - Identify data sources with the greatest risk exposure or audit failure and help prioritize where to focus first
  - Build on classification and vulnerability assessment
5. Data and file activity monitoring
  - Capture and record real-time data access activity
  - Centralized policies
  - Resource intensive
6. Real-time Alerting
7. Blocking Masking, and Quarantining
  - Obscure data and/or blocking further action by risky users when activities deviate from regular baseline or pre-defined policies
  - Provide only level of access to data necessary
8. Active Analytics
  - Capture insight into key threats such as, SQL injections, malicious stored procedures, DoS, Data leakage, Account takeover, data tampering, schema tampering etc
  - Develop recommendations for actions to reduce risk
9. Encryption
10. Tokenization
  - A special type of format-preserving encryption that substitutes sensitive data with a token, which can be mapped to the original value
11. Key Management
  - Securely distribute keys across complex encryption landscape
  - Centralize key management
  - Enable organized, secure key management that keeps data private and compliant
12. Automated Compliance Report
  - Pre-built capabilities mapped to specific regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, CCPA and so on
  - Includes:
    - Audit workflows to streamline approval processes
    - Out-of-the-box reports
    - Pre-built classification patterns for regulated data
    - Tamper-proof audit repository

## **Mobile Endpoint Protection**
  
  **iOS**
- Developed by Apple
- Launched in 2007
- ~13% of devices (based on usage)
- ~60% of tablets worldwide run iOS/iPadOS
- MDM capabilities available since iOS 6
  
  **Android**
- Android Inc. was a small team working on an alternative to Symbian and Windows Mobile OS.
- Purchased by Google in 2005 – the Linux kernel became the base of the Android OS. Now developed primarily by Google and a consortium known as **Open Handset Alliance.**
- First public release in 2008
- ~86% of smartphones and ~39% of tablets run some form of Android.
- MDM capabilities since Android 2.2.

### How do mobile endpoints differ from traditional endpoints?

- Users don’t interface directly with the OS.
- A series of applications act as a broker between the user and the OS.
- OS stability can be easily monitored, and any anomalies reported that present risk.
- Antivirus software can “see” the apps that are installed on a device, and reach certain signatures, but can not peek inside at their contents.

### Primary Threats To Mobile Endpoints
  
  **System based:**
- Jailbreaking and Rooting exploit vulnerabilities to provide root access to the system.
- Systems that were previously read-only can be altered in malicious ways.
- One primary function is to gain access to apps that are not approved or booting.
- Vulnerabilities and exploits in the core code can open devices to remote attacks that provide root access.
  
  **App based threats:**
- Phishing scams – via SMS or email
- Malicious code
- Apps may request access to hardware features irrelevant to their functionality
- Web content in mobile browsers, especially those that prompt for app installations, can be the root cause of many attacks
  
  **External:**
- Network based attacks
- Tethering devices to external media can be exploited for vulnerabilities
- Social engineering to unauthorized access to the device

### Protection mobile assets

- **MDM:** Control the content allowed on the devices, restrict access to potentially dangerous features.
- **App security**: Report on the health and reliability of applications, oftentimes before they even make it on the devices.
- **User Training**

### Day-to-day operations
  
While it may seem like a lot to monitor hundreds, thousands, or hundreds of thousands of devices daily, much of the information can be digested by automated systems and action taken without much admin interactions.
