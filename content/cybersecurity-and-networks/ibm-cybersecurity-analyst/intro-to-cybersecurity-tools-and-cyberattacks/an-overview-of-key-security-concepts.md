## **CIA Triad**

### CIA Triad – Confidentiality
  
“To prevent any disclosure of data without prior authorization by the owner.”
- We can force Confidentiality with encryption
- Elements such as authentication, access controls, physical security and permissions are normally used to enforce Confidentiality.

### CIA Triad – Integrity

- Normally implemented to verify and validate if the information that we sent or received has not been modified by an unauthorized person of the system.
- We can implement technical controls such as algorithms or hashes (MD5, SHA1, etc.)

### CIA Triad – Availability

- The basic principle of this term is to be sure that the information and data is always available when needed.
- Technical Implementations
  + RAIDs
  + Clusters (Different set of servers working as one)
  + ISP Redundancy
  + Back-Ups

## **Non-Repudiation – How does it apply to CIA?**
  
  “Valid proof of the identity of the data sender or receiver”
- Technical Implementations:
  + Digital signatures
  + Logs

## **Access Management**

- Access criteria
  + Groups
  + Time frame and specific dates
  + Physical location
  + Transaction type
- “Needed to Know” Just access information needed for the role
- Single Sign-on (SSO)

## **Incident Response**
  
  “Computer security incident management involves the monitoring and detection of security events on a computer or a computer network and the execution of proper resources to those events. Means the information security or the incident management team will regularly check and monitor the security events occurring on a computer or in our network.”

### Incident Management

- Events
- Incident
- Response team: Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)
- Investigation

## **Key Concepts – Incident Response**

### E-Discovery
  
  Data inventory, helps to understand the current tech status, data classification, data management, we could use automated systems. Understand how you control data retention and backup.

### Automated Systems
  
  Using SIEM, SOA, UBA, Big data analysis, honeypots/honey-tokens. Artificial Intelligence or other technologies, we could enhance the mechanism to detect and control incidents that could compromise the tech environment.

### BCP (Business Continuity Plan) & Disaster Recovery
  
  Understand the company in order to prepare the BCP. A BIA, it's good to have a clear understanding of the critical business areas. Also indicate if a security incident will trigger the BCP or the Disaster Recovery.

### Post Incident
  
  Root-Cause analysis, understand the difference between error, problem and isolated incident. Lessons learned and reports are a key.

## **Incident Response Process**
  
+ Prepare
+ Respond
+ Follow up

## **Introduction to Frameworks and Best Practices**


### Best Practices, baseline, and frameworks

- Used to improve the controls, methodologies, and governance for the IT departments or the global behavior of the organization.
- Seeks to improve performance, controls, and metrics.
- Helps to translate the business needs into technical or operational needs.

### Normative and compliance

- Rules to follow for a specific industry.
- Enforcement for the government, industry, or clients.
- Event if the company or the organization do not want to implement those controls, for compliance.

### Best practices, frameworks, and others

- COBIT
- ITIL
- ISOs
- COSO
- Project manager methodologies
- Industry best practices
- Developer recommendations
- others

## **IT Governance Process**

### Security Policies, procedures, and other
  
+ Strategic and Tactic plans
+ Procedures
+ Policies
+ Governance
+ Others

## **Cybersecurity Compliance and Audit Overview**
  
  Compliance;
  + SOX
  + HIPAA
  + GLBA
  + PCI/DSS

- Audit
  + Define audit scope and limitations
  + Look for information, gathering information
  + Do the audit (different methods)
  + Feedback based on the findings
  + Deliver a report
  + Discuss the results

## **Pentest Process and Mile 2 CPTE Training**

### Pentest – Ethical Hacking
  
A method of evaluating computer and network security by simulating an attack on a computer system or network from external and internal threats.
